# This is a John Conway's Game Of Life implementation

This implementation is made in c on the console. 

While running the compiled file, you can type a 1 to start with a random configuration or a 0 to start with a personal configuration which is written in the file named `configuration.txt`. 
Death cells are represented with spacebar spaces and living cells are represented with asterisks.
