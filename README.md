# This is a implementation of The Game of Life created by John Conway

This implementation is built in c and runs on the console. 

While running the compiled file, you can type a 1 to start with a random configuration or a 0 to start with a personal configuration which is written in the file named `configuration.txt`. 
Death cells are represented with spacebar blank spaces and living cells are represented with asterisks.
